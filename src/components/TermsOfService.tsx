Key characteristics of the service include:" },
			{
				type: "list",
				items: ["It is free. There is no payment, pricing tier, or subscription.", "It handles plain-text notes only. It does not support rich media, and unsupported or non-text files are rejected on import. Notes can be exported as plain .txt files.", "Your notes are stored locally on your device in your browser (in an IndexedDB database named quick-pad). There is no server-side storage of your notes for local use.", "It is installable as a Progressive Web App and continues to work offline once its app shell has been cached by a service worker (in production builds).", "Google Drive sync is an optional feature that is fully off unless you choose to turn it on by signing in with Google."]

		heading: "3. No account required; optional Google sign-in",
		blocks: [
			{ type: "paragraph", text: "You do not need to create an account, register, or log in to create and store notes locally. QuickPad works entirely on your device without any sign-in, and if Google sign-in is unavailable or you have not enabled it, QuickPad runs entirely on your device. If you never sign in, your notes are not transmitted off your device by QuickPad." },
			{ type: "paragraph", text: "If you want to back up and synchronize your notes across devices, you may optionally sign in with Google. Signing in requests access to a private application-data folder in your own Google Drive and to your basic Google profile (your email address and name). It is used only to provide optional Google Drive sync and to keep you signed in; it is never used for tracking or advertising." },
			{ type: "paragraph", text: `When you sign in, more than your notes is involved. QuickPad's serverless backend receives an authentication token (a Google refresh token) and your Google account email and display name. These are decoded from the identity token Google returns and are stored in an encrypted, server-side session cookie so that you can stay signed in; short-lived access tokens are then obtained on your behalf. Your email, name, access token, and token expiry are also cached locally in your browser. The details of what is collected, where it is stored, and how long it is kept are described in the "Privacy and data handling" section below and in our Privacy Policy.` },

QuickPad stores the notes you author and the plain-text files you import or export; it does not review, curate, or moderate your content.", "Keep your own backups.

Your use of Google services is also subject to Google's own terms."]

The app cannot recover notes once your browser's local data has been cleared.", "Deleted notes are moved to Trash rather than removed immediately. Trashed notes are eligible for permanent deletion after 30 days and are purged automatically when the app next runs its cleanup, which removes both their metadata and their content. For a synced account this purge also propagates to your Google Drive app-data folder.", "Sync is best-effort. Optional Google Drive sync depends on Google's services, your Google account, and network conditions, and may fail, be delayed, or be incomplete. After a change, an automatic upload is briefly delayed (debounced) before it is sent. Sync resolves differences using a last-write-wins approach based on note timestamps, so a newer copy can overwrite an older one.", "QuickPad does not guarantee that the service, or any synced copy of your data, will be available, uninterrupted, error-free, or retained. You should not rely on QuickPad as your only copy of important information."]

No account is required, and no notes are sent to any server when you use QuickPad locally. QuickPad reads from your browser's older localStorage only once, to migrate any data from older versions of the app into IndexedDB, after which those legacy entries are removed; localStorage is not used for ongoing storage or tracking." },
			{ type: "paragraph", text: "Contacting Google when the page loads. QuickPad loads Google's Identity Services script from accounts.google.com on every page load (and includes a DNS-prefetch hint to the same Google origin).

That cookie is set with the HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Lax attributes and has a long lifetime (a maximum age of approximately 400 days). The refresh token is kept only on the server side and is not exposed to your browser in plaintext.", "A short-lived OAuth state cookie (named qp_oauth) is also set briefly during the sign-in flow for security (to protect against cross-site request forgery) and is cleared shortly afterward.", "Your email, name, a short-lived Google access token, and that token's expiry are also cached locally in your browser's IndexedDB so that you stay signed in.

The uploaded file contains the full note, including its title, full body text, all timestamps, the note's randomly generated identifier, and derived metadata (a short summary made from the first part of the content, along with sentence, word, and character counts). All Drive requests are authorized only with a short-lived access token; no other credentials are sent to Google's Drive API. Deleting a note (including emptying Trash) also deletes the corresponding file from your Drive app-data folder." },
			{ type: "paragraph", text: "No analytics, tracking, or advertising. QuickPad contains no analytics, telemetry, tracking, advertising, session-replay, or tracking-pixel code, and sets no tracking or analytics cookies. The only cookies it uses are the server-side OAuth session and OAuth-state cookies described above, which exist solely to support optional Google sign-in. At runtime, the only external services the app contacts are Google (for the optional sign-in and Drive sync features) and QuickPad's own first-party backend used for the sign-in flow." },
			{ type: "paragraph", text: "Signing out and deleting your data. You can sign out at any time from within the app. Signing out revokes QuickPad's Google access grant with Google, clears the server-side session, and clears the locally cached access token, user information, and sync metadata. You can remove your locally stored notes and data by deleting them in the app or by clearing your browser's site data, and you can remove synced copies by deleting the relevant notes (which propagates the deletion to your Drive app-data folder) or by managing QuickPad's access and app data through your Google account." }

For material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to highlight them on this page or within the app where practicable; because QuickPad does not maintain user accounts or contact details, we cannot notify users individually, so we encourage you to review these Terms periodically.
